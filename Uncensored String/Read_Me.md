Difficulty: Hard

Someone has attempted to censor my strings by replacing every vowel with a *, l*k* th*s. Luckily, I've been able to find the vowels that were removed.
Given a censored string and a string of the censored vowels, return the original uncensored string.

Example:

("Wh*r* d*d my v*w*ls g*?", "eeioeo") ➞ "Where did my vowels go?"
("abcd", "") ➞ "abcd"
('Ch**s*, Gr*mm*t -- ch**s*', 'eeeoieee') ➞ 'Cheese, Grommit -- cheese' (Works with * at the end)
('*l*ph*nt', 'Eea') ➞ 'Elephant' (Works with * at the start)
("*PP*RC*S*", "UEAE") ➞ "UPPERCASE"
